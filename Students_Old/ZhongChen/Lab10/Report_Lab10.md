## Background

In this lab,we we will measure the dielectric constants for various liquids using open-ended coaxial probe.<br>

## Design


There was no design for this lab, the only part was the measurement which was done by David.

## Procedure

David had a set-up which consisted of a coaxial probe that was connected to a stand. The first step of the measuring was to calibrate the set-up. For the particular calibration, there are three calibration requirements, air, short and water. Then Dadid test different types of fulids. <br>

Note: Before each measurement,the probe was re-calibrated.

## Conclusion
Before the lab, it was stated that water has the highest dielectric of 80. This was confiremed in the lab and it was seen that the fluids that had higher dielectrics were fluids that have been watered-down. 

## Reflection
No.
