## Background

One method to find the dielectric of a liquid is to use a dielectric probe. The dielectric probe is a well matched 50 Ohm coaxial probe that is first calibrated using a Short, Open, Load method. The probe is then inserted into the liquid and the fringing fields from the open circuit go into the liquid. The reflection is then measured and can be used to find E' and E", and these values can then be used to find the dielectric of the material over a certain frequency range.

## Design

This lab did not require any device design. The dielectric constant can be found using the equation below

## Procedure

In lab, the probe was first calibrated using a short (given with the device), an open (just in air), and a load which is DI water. DI water is used because it has the highest dielectric of any liquid, giving the best calibration. Then the probe is dipped into each liquid and E' and E" are measured.

## Results and Discussion

The graphs below show the values for E' of each material from 1 to 5 GHZ and the dielectric constant of water from 20 MHZ to 20 GHZ. All of the cleaning products had high E' values (glass cleaner being the highest,) which means that they contain a high percentage of water. The other liquids tested have lower values of E', which means they do not contain a significant percentage of water. The average measured values of the known chemicals is compared to the actual values found online. Some material vary in actual to measured more than others. This is explained by the solutions tested are not pure, errors in the calibration form movement in the set up, and variance in the dielectric over the frequency range.

## Conclusion
Materials that had higher E' values have more water in them. Materials that did not contain water had very low E' values. This process was highly sensitive to the movement and placement of the probe and the cables it was attached to. Ways to improve this lab include re calibrating in between each material tested, larger sample sizes used to maintain a better open circuit coax model, and better cleaning of the probe in between measurements. 

## Hindsight
This lab was just observation and just data processing after the data was measured.

## Reflection
This lab gave insight into how the dielectric of a material is found.
