# Lab 5 Report (Unfinished)
Jared Pocock

## Background
The devices in this lab are a TRL calibration device and a PIN diode. The goal of the lab was to adjust the lengths and widths of the devices until they operate properly at the design frequencies.

## Design
All of the calculations done for this lab were done using the online microstrip calculator at http://www1.sphere.ne.jp/i-lab/ilab/tool/ms_line_e.htm. Inputting the relative dielectric constant of 4.1, characteristic impedance of 50 ohm, h=1.5748 mm, and f=3000 MHz the microstrip width is calculated to be about 3.1 mm and the quarter wavelength section for the line section is about 14 mm. Using the calculator for the PIN switch using the same numbers with f=2500 MHz instead, the microstrip line width is calculated to be about 3.12 mm. Changing the characteristic impedance to 100 ohm, the width of the stubs are calculated to be about .72 mm and the length is about 17.8 mm. Some of the lengths had to be fine tuned a little bit for ideal output.

## Procedure
For the first part of the lab, the simulation of the TRL was edited so that the microstrip width and the length matched the parameters of a TRL circuit. The reflect line is the reference length, the thru is twice the reference length, and the line length is twice the reference length plus an additional length of a quarter wavelength of the design frequency (3 GHz in this case). The quarter wavelength length was calculated using the online calculator. After the circuit was simulated, graphs were made in Python to compare against the measured data. The same procedure was used for the PIN diode. The microstrip line width and the quarter wavelength length were found using the calculator and inserted into the model and graphs were made of the results. 

## Results and Discussion

The results from the simulations in HFSS are similar to what was measured.

Some reasons for the differences between simulated and measured values is that the network analyzer took more data points per frequency while the simulated has just one point per step in frequency.

The phase velocity of the TRL is simply the speed of light divided by the effective dielectric constant which was calculated to be 3.15. This gives a velocity of 1.69*10^8 m/s

The coefficients for the polynomial fitting are 1E-15*X^3 - 2E-14*X^2 + 6E-14*X + 1E-14. I haven't been able to graph it in Python yet.

## Conclusion
The key points to the lab are to understand the various lengths of the TRL circuit and the PIN diode. Knowing how the lengths of the thru, reflect, and line are related makes the lab much simpler to complete. Similarly knowing the lengths of the stubs in the diode circuit should be a quarter wavelength again makes that part of the lab much easier.

## Hindsight
I wish I knew Python better before this lab. It took me a while with the TA's help to figure out how to do plots in Python. 

## Reflection
The most challenging part of the lab was just getting the software to work correctly. I didn't know that the HFSS files had to be pulled from Github, and not just copied from the site. After that, the lab went pretty smoothly.
