# Lab 11 Report
Matias Kalaswad

In this lab I worked with Chloe Dixon and Matthew Walck. Some of the things that we worked on include lab reports and plots.

## Background
This lab introduced us to a calibration technique called the Gated Reflect Line or GRL. It is used for free space calibration on devices like the horn antennas that we used in lab. The S11 parameter in time domain can be used to locate discontinuities as a function of time. It can show you where unwanted reflections are occurring so you can filter them with gating. This helps with calibration.

## Design
There was no design portion in this lab.

## Procedure
In lab David demonstrated how the GRL calibration works. We tested large sheets of different materials. First David calibrated the cables to the horn antennas. He placed a piece of plexiglass (acrylic) in the holders that was the same thickness as the reflect sheet (5.6mm). We tested a sheet of metal and cardboard as well. The data was then put through a time domain Fourier transformation. 

## Results and Discussion
Ideally the thru should have very little attenuation, whereas this graph has a very large slope. In reality this result is actually very close to what itâ€™s supposed to look like. If the y-axis showed more dB values, we would be able to see that the S21 values are extremely close to zero, which is what they should be for low attenuation.

## Conclusion
The main point of this lab was to see the GRL calibration and watch how the dielectric constants of solids could be measured.  David explained to us that this setup was far from perfect some there was a margin of error that could be seen but for the most part it was an accurate depiction of the process.

## Hindsight
We probably could have tested a few more materials since the process was not too time consuming. However, the results we got gave us a pretty good idea of how the GRL works.

## Reflection
This being our last lab was a bittersweet moment. Overall the lab portion of this class exceeded my expectations and I had a lot of fun. It was cool being in a lab room and being able to not only work with some of the equipment, but also see some of the other projects that were going on.
