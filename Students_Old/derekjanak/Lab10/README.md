Lab 10: Measurement of Electrical Properties of Liquids

Background:

In this lab the electrical properties of various materials were measured using a coaxial probe
technique.  This technique is useful for accurately measuring material properties of substances
which allow immersion of the probe.  This measurement is used to then calculate and predict the
behavior of electromagnetic waves propagating in these materials.

Applications:

The method demonstrated in this lab is useful for obtaining parameters such as effective 
permittivity of liquids and soft solids.  This data is necessary to determine the behavior of EM
waves incident at material boundaries or propagating through the material.  These parameters
might be used in instances such as investigating radio transmission through water, electrical
imaging techniques, and lens design.  Additionally, the dielectric probe is capable of taking wideband
measurements, making it useful over a broad frequency range.

Design:

The laboratory setup consisted of a ring stand used to hold beakers of various liquids.  The probe
was clamped to the ring stand with the tip immersed in the liquid being measured.  The probe was
connected to the network analyzer used to take the measurements.  Distilled water was used as a calibration
due to its exceptionally high resistivity compared to other liquids.  The process could be improved by using liquids
of greater resistivity (assuming that they exist) or by increasing the depth of the liquid sample to capture more of the
fringing fields.

Results:

The plot makes it easy to compare the various fluids based on their permittivities.  Note that distilled water has the highest real component of relative permittivity, followed by the water based solutions.  By comparison, it has one of the lower imaginary components of relative permittivity.

The DI water sweep from 20 MHz to 20 GHz revealed a surprising trend in which the real impedance declined and the imaginary impednace grew.  This agrees with theoretical expectations for the permittivity of water, which refracts higher frequencies to a greater degree than low frequencies (rainbows result from this effect).

Conclusion:

This lab allowed students to see the way in which some electrical parameters of materials are
measured.  The various materials which were measured served to provide ample data to compare and
contrast various materials.  The brief investigation provided a framework upon which to build
additional data acquisition techniques.

In general, the liquids with the highest water content had the highest real permittivity values.
Glass cleaner had the highest water content; other liquids in the "watered down" group included
pine sol and simple green.

Hindsight:

I felt adequately prepared for this lab, as all relevant information was discussed in class.

Reflection:

The lab demonstration provided no challenge, but it was rewarding to see the method in which the
parameters of various materials are obtained.  The knowledge of these measurements gave a more
complete understanding of the calculations carried out in this course and in preceeding courses.
