## Background

In this lab, dielectric constant are measured for several materials using free space method.<br>

## Design

There was no design for this lab, the only part was the measurement which was done by David.

## Procedure

David walked through the steps and demoed the GRL calibration for the lab. The setup for this calibration consisted of two horn antenna facing each other with a sheet between them. These horn antennas were dual polarized with a frequency range from 2GHz to 18GHz. <br>
Step 1: Two-port SOLT calibration. This was to calibrate the cables that connected to the antennas. There is a sample between the antennas. The sample was Plexiglas that had a thickness of 5.6mm which was the same thickness of the reflect sheet. 
Step 2: Replace the sample with the metal reflect sheet. Once the calibration was completed, the data gathered had to go through a Time-Domain Fourier transform which allows to see where the calibration needs to be gated around.

## Conclusion
It can be seen that the gated reflection happens around 3.66ns. The software that is used for the TDF helps clean up the measurement so that the effect of the GRL can be accurately studied. However, some errors like antenna alignment error and cable alignment error may cause some problems.

## Reflection

Each of these labs were useful and well-constructed.
