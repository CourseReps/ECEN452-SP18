# Lab 10 Report
Thomas Darden

## Background
In this lab we are going to find the dielectric constant of different liquids by measuring it with a probe. The dielectric probe is a matched 50ohm coaxial probe that is first calibrated using a short, open, and load method. The probe then measures the fringing fields produced in the material from the open circuit. This measurement then can give us E' and E" which allow us to find the dielectric constant over a certain range.

## Design
No design was made for this lab.

## Procedure
Watch David perform the calibaration and measure the E' and E" values and record the measurements.

## Results and Discussion
For this lab, I have graphed the results of the dielectric materials that were measured. The liquids that had more water in them tended to have a higher dielectric constant near DI water, where as those that had less water had a low dielectric value. The results were plotted in the following graph:

We also plotted the dielectric constant for DI water over a larger range to have a better understand of how the constant changes after a certain frequency range.

The values that we got for our measurements were roughly the same as the standard values for the dielectric constants of these materials.
For Acetone, we measured 20.9 when the actual was 20.7
For Ethylene Gylcol, we measured 37.9 when the actual was 37.
For Isopropyl Alcohol, we measured 19.9 when the actual was 17.9.
For Silicone Fluid, we measured 1.92 when the actual was 2.18.

## Conclusion
From this lab, I can conclude that the higher the dielectric constant a material has, the more likely it is to be water based. Our test setup did cause errors within our measurement, as the liquids had been sitting our for about a week and their purity was questionable (they could have had contaminants like dust). Our test setup was also extremely senstive to movement. A way we could improve our measurements is by taking the measurments right after we open the product and by having multiple samples to eliminate noise.

## Hindsight
N/A

## Reflection
This lab was very informative on how the dielectric constants of certain materials can be found.
