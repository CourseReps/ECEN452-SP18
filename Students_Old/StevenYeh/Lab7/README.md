Task 1: Wilkinson Power Divider Design<br>
<br>Step 1:In this exercise, a two ways power divider will be designed and simulated in the HFSS. The power divider should have 3 dB equal split characteristics at 2.5 GHz. A minimum return loss at each port should be less than -10 dB and a decent isolation between port #2 and port #3 is wanted. All the ports have characteristic impedance of 50 Ohm.<br>
<b>Ans:<br>
The design layout along with the parameters(width, length and so on) are shown in the following figure.<br>

Figure 2 - Design parameter<br><br>

A 100 Ohm resistor is connected at the joint of the traces to provide good isolation between port #2 and port #3. The quarter-wavelength ring structure has impedance of 70.71 Ohm and trace length of 17.36mm. The traces after the ring structure are also quarter-wavelength and have impedance tapering features. Because the designs are all symmetric, we are supposed to have a 3 dB power split result.<br></b>

<br>Step 2: Next, the S parameters of the Wilkinson power divider are illustrated below.<br>
<b>Ans:<br>

Figure 3 - S parameters<br><br>

The results shown a very close power split between port #2 and port #3 which are -3.57 dB and -3.59 dB, respectively. An -14.89 dB isolation is founded between port #2 and port #3. Next, all the ports have return loss less than -14.75 dB are observed. The insertion loss is around 0.5 dB from port #1 to port #2 or port #3 which is acceptable at 2.5 GHz. A little bit losses come from the conductor or dielectric material are expected. The FR4 substrate can provide acceptable performance at 2.5 GHz.</b><br>

<br>Step 3: Finally, the simulated and measured data are compared and shown in the following figures. The results are close from the simulated and measured data.<br>
