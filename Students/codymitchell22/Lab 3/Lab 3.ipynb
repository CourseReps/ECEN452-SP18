    "As you know, 2-port networks have four S-parameters, the reflection coefficients being S11, S22, and the transmission coefficients S21, S12. In general, S21 is the measurement of the complex output/Input transfer function. Complex means that it represents both gain (or insertion loss) and phase relationship between the input and the output signals.  As shown in the equations below, gain is referred to as a positive number, and insertion loss is negative; both are typically expressed in dB.  The third equation is he phase response of the network. In this lab, our main focus will be on the phase response of the system, rather than the magnitude response. In regard to S21, the phase defines how much shift occurs for each frequency.\n",
