## Background
The Dielectric probe measurement system uses the magnitude and phase of the S-Parameters of different materials to characterize their permittivity and permeability. The result is highly dependent on the topology of the measurement device used. This lab used a coaxial probe to take the dielectric measeurements. The probe has a sophisitcated error model, and a three stage calibration is used to remove error terms. The first two stages use a shorted and open circuit load, while the third stage uses DI Water. DI water has the advantages that its properties are extremely well known, and its characteristic impedance is far enough away from the open and short circuit points on a smith chart to make it an acceptable load. 

## Procedure
The dielectric probe was calibrated for the measurement of a variety of materials, including Acetone, Isopropyl alcohol, DI water among others. To produce the most accurate measurements, the probe was recalibrated in between each measurement. 

## Results and Discussion
![Permittivity](https://github.com/CourseReps/ECEN452-Spring2016/blob/master/Students/joshruff/Lab10/Permittivity.png)<br>
Glass cleaner correlated most closely to water, while Pine Sol and Simple Green cleaner both had high permittivity values, which shows that they are relatively watered down. Ethylene Glycol and Isopropyl Alcohol had similar shapes, and correlated more closely as frequency increased. Acetone remained roughly constant at a relative permittivity of 20. Silicone Fluid, Hydrocal, and WD-40 all have very close permitivities, which shows that they all have a high oil content.<br>

This measurement starts out neear 80 as expected, but falls off as the frequency increases into the Gigahertz range, which shows that the probe is more accurate for smaller frequency ranges. 
## Conclusion
The Dielectric constant of a varietey of materials was measured, and the results were used to make generalizations about the contents of the materials. Glass cleaner, Pine Sol, and Simple Green Cleaner all had relatively high water content, while WD-40, Silicone Fluid and Hydrocal were more oil based.
