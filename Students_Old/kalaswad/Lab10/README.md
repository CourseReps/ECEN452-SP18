# Lab 10 Report
Matias Kalaswad

In this lab I worked with Chloe Dixon and Matthew Walck. Some of the things that we worked on include lab reports and plots.

## Background
This lab gave us a great demonstration of measuring dielectric constants. David used a coaxial probe which is basically just a simple open-ended section of coaxial cable. The dielectric constant is the relative permittivity of a dielectric material.  It is very beneficial in characterizing capacitors. 

## Design
There was no design stage for this lab.

## Procedure
In lab David measured the dielectric constants of 10 materials using the coaxial probe discussed in the introduction. He first had to calibrate the probe by measuring air, short, and water.  Water has the highest dielectric constant, so we were able to compare how much smaller the other materials’ dielectric constants were. The probe had to be re-calibrated between each material. 

## Results and Discussion
The plots confirm that water has the highest dielectric constant. We used DI water because it does not have extra ions that would affect the probe when calibrating. Water that is less pure, like tap water, would have these ions which would make later measurements less accurate. The dielectric constants of liquids are measuring the ability of a substance to store electrical energy in an electric field; so we can generalize the liquids that are good at storing energy like water and glass cleaner, versus the ones that are not good at storing energy like silicon fluid and WD-40. Glass cleaner and Simple Green were considered “watered down” because they had dielectric constants closest to water.

## Conclusion
The main points of this lab were to prove the fact that water has the highest dielectric constant, as discussed in class, and to show us a reliable way to measure the dielectric constant of liquids.

## Hindsight
This was one of the simplest labs and there wasn't much we could have done differently or prepared for. 

## Reflection
This was a really laid-back lab and also one of the easiest to understand. I'm glad we were able to study electromagnetic properties in other mediums, such as liquids.
