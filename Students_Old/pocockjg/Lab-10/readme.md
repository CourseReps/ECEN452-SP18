# Lab 10 Report
Jared Pocock

## Background
This lab uses a probe to measure the relative permitivity of various materials. Before measuring though, the probe has to be calibrated properly.

## Design
No designs were needed for the lab. There were only measurments.

## Procedure
The first step in the lab was to calibrate the probe. The probe first measured in air, then the probe measured the surface of a metal cube, and then finally measured while being submersed in DI water. With these calibration measurments, any noise or distortions are mostly eliminated from the system.

## Results and Discussion

The measurements are around the expected values.

The dielectric constant of water decreases as the frequency increases.

The reason DI water is used for callibrations is that because it's dielectric constant is widely known so it can be used for eliminating noise in the probe.

Improving the calibration process would require more sensitive probes and likely a more controlled environment instead of a (sort of) makeshift lab in Wisenbaker.

The probe can be used for wideband measurements as the DI water measurement was taken from the 20 MHz to 20 GHz range

The relative dielectric constant does seem to provide a measurement of how viscous a fluid is. Fluids that have a low relative dielectric constant, like Hydrocal, are much thicker than liquids of higher dielectric constants like water.

Simple Green, Pine-Sol, and the Glass cleaner can all be considered watered down with the Glass Cleaner being the closest to water.

## Conclusion
Not much to say, just a simple measurement lab. 

## Hindsight
Nothing

## Reflection
Easiest lab I ever had.
