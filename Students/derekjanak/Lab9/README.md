Lab 9: Design of a Microstrip Patch Antenna

Background:

In this lab, students designed and fabricated a microstrip patch antenna.  Microstrip patch
antennas are useful at high frequencies due to their ease of fabrication and their conveniece
of design.  They also face significant limitations such as narrow bandwidth and low power
limitations.  Additionally, they are impractical at low frequencies, where their size is
prohibitively large.

Antennas are applied as both recievers and transmitters in various circuit configurations.  The
important properties of antennas include directivity and gain, bandwidth, center frequency, and
efficiency of reception/transmission.  Multiple antennas can also be combined into an array to
increase effectiveness.  By combining signals sent/recieved from multiple antennas, more
efficient signal transmission can be achieved and noise filtering and error correction are
easier to perform.  Additionally, by varying the phase of antennas in an array, the beam of
the antenna can be steered to target various angles of signal propagation.

Patch antennas such as the one designed in this lab can be found in many diverse applications
within embedded systems.  One example of such a system is the satellite radio reciever in a car.

Design:

The patch antenna design in this lab was constructed by laying copper tape onto a 62 mil FR4
substrate.  The width was calculated first according to equations provided in the lab manual.
Next the relative permittivity was calculated and used to calculate a resonant half wavelength
length of patch.  Then a length compensation factor (necessary to compensate for capacitive
effects) was calculated and subtracted from the patch length to determine the final length of
the patch.  After measuring the impedance of the patch plus a 50 ohm feedline, a quarter wave
transformer was inserted in order to match the antenna to the input port.

All calculations and diagrams are included in the scanned lab notebook pages.

Procedure:

The antenna was constructed according to the calculated design values on 62 mil FR4 substrate
using copper tape.  Then the network analyzer was used to measure the impedance of the circuit.
A Smith chart calculation was performed in order to obtain a real impedance and a position
on the feedline to implement a quarter wave transformer.  The resulting matched antenna was
measured using the network analyzer, and the data was saved and plotted.

Results:

See plots included in lab.

Conclusion:

In this lab, students designed a patch antenna and matched it to an input feedline.  The design
served as an introduction to antenna design and as a preparation for the final project of designing
an antenna array.  The design required an understanding of Smith chart use and transmission line
calculations in order for it to be correctly matched and implemented.

Hindsight:

In hindsight, I felt adequately prepared for this lab.  I do wish that I had been able to examine
additional antenna designs, but overall I had plenty of knowledge and ability to complete this
exercise.

Reflection:

The most challenging part of the lab was the design stage.  My calculations contained an error
which led to incorrect results and a significant amount of time invested in order to correct it.
However, the reward of this lab was that it demystified antenna design and illustrated the 
concepts necessary for obtaining a basic grasp of antenna fundamentals.
