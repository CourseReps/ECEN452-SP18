#Lab 11 Report

Chung-Huan Huang

## Background
In this lab, dielectric constant are measured for several materials using free space method.
<br>

## Design
No design for this lab, the whole process of this lab was done by David.
<br>

## Procedure 
Two antennas are placed facing with each other and connected to VNA. VNA must be calibrated before measuring. Two port SLOT calibration was done for cables first and GRL calibration was used secondly for antennas. Sample holder here is chosen as plexiglass, and reflect sheet is chosen as metal. Once calibration is done, MUT will be put between two antennas and start measuring. 
<br>

## Results and Discussion

It can be seen that the maximum reflected signal is occurred at about 3.6ns.

<br>Q1: Signals are recevied with time, so that we can easily see when the signal comes into the antenna.
<br>	
<br>Q2: The maximum main beam represents MUT position and sencond highest sidelobe will be gated reflection which is occurred at 3.6ns.
<br>
<br>Q3: Time domain gating is to ensure there are no multiple reflections in the sample itself, though appropriate thickness should able to avoid this.
<br>
<br>Q4: A metal plate is used to reflect all of the incident energy back to the transmitter. It means the metal plate is an isolation standard, as no signal should be detected at the opposite antenna.
<br>
<br>Q5: Dielectric constant of air is almost close to one and can be regarded as a standard. Cardboard expected dielectric constant is from 2 to 5 depending on moisture and ingredient of board. Plexiglass expected dielectric constant is about 2.6~3.5. Air and plexiglass measurements are located within expected values. Cardboard measurement is slightly lower than expected value.
<br>
<br>Q6: A fixed platform of antenna can be built to ensure the stability of antenna for improving calibration process.

## Conclusion
Three dielectric constant measurements are similiar to our expected values. The difference may be caused by antenna alignment error, cable alignment error.

## Hindsight
MUT should be flat and large as possible for precise result. Antennas should be aligned to each other as precise as possible.
<br>

## Reflection
This is one of the ways to measure dielectric constant, especially is designed for undetructive materials. It is very great to see the process of measuring.
