## Background
Dielectric Probe Measurement reports the dielectric constant of a liquid based on the comparison between liquid under test and water 
(or liquid with well-known high dielectric constant)

## Procedure
1. calibrating dielectric probe from 200MHz to 5GHz using air, shorting block, and DI water. (similar to open, short and load calibration)
2. The dielectric probe is submerge into different liquids to measure their dielectri consant.

             'Isopropyl_Alcohol', 'Pine_sol', 'Silicone_Fluid', 'Simple_Green', 'WD_40']

## Results and Discussion
1. water-based liquids all have high dielectric constant compared to acetone-based liquid.

1. At DI water dielectric constant is gradually decreasing as frequency increase.

## Conclusion
How the dielectric constant of DI water was found and used as a standard before there is a dielectric probe measurement system?

## Hindsight
Dielectric probe is very sensitive to its movement.
