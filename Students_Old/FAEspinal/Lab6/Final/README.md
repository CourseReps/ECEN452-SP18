# Lab 6 Report
Francisco A. Espinal

## Background

We design two filters a maximally flat low pass and equi-ripple band stop filter. These filters accept desired signals and reject signals outside the operation band. To design them we must find the order (N) of the filter and using this information construct a Ladder network.  Then additional transformations, such as Richard’s transformation, and Kuroda identities can be used to calculate the transmission lines and stubs needed.      


## Design

First I calculated the order (N). Using the information given I plug it into the |w/w_c|-1 equation and got 0.3. I looked it up on the graph with the attenuations, and determined that the order was 5. From here I followed the steps given to us in the lab walking us through the transformation. Once they were transformed I calculated the widths and lengths of the t-lines. 
     
To calculate the width and effective dielectric of each device I used an online calculator. (http://www1.sphere.ne.jp/i-lab/ilab/tool/ms_line_e.htm) Thickness used was 62mil. To get the actual physical lengths I used the equation below.

I plug in the effective dielectric, frequency, and 45 for theta because we wanted the half of a quarter wavelength. I preformed the same method of calculations for both designs.

I used the equation L=(1/2*pi)tan^-1(89/2*Z_0) to find the lengths of the lines.

## Procedure
For the first design, I started off by finding the order (N) of the filter using the giving specification. With the order I found the Element values. Next I assembled the ladder network and transformed them using Richard’s Transformation and Kuroda’s identities. Then I found the lengths of each line and plugged them into HFSS. Got all the values and compared their behaviors in python.  I did the same with the second design.

## Conclusion
Overall my filters worked in their desired range.  

## Hindsight
The only thing I wish I would have had know before starting this lab was knowing how to use HFSS a little bit better.  

## Reflection
Everything was pretty straightforward, I didn’t have trouble with any part of the lab.
