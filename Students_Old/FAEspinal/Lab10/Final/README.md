# Lab 10 Report

## Background
In this lab we used a dielectric probe to determine the dielectric properties of multiple material. We used a network analyzer connected to a coaxial probe to take the measurements. 

## Design
We didn’t have a design. No calculations were made. 

## Procedure
Everything was already set up and ready to go when we got into the lab. We just watch our TA preform all the necessary tasks. First he calibrated the probe in order for us to get precise measurements using water, a short, and a open. Then he measured multiple materials as we listened to him explain everything he was doing.  

## Results and Discussion

The higher the dielectric constant (the ones close to 80), the more water down it is. The lower the dielectric constant means its less water down and contains more alcohol/oil. The most watered down liquid with the highest water contented was the glass cleaner.

The probe accuracy decreased as the frequency got bigger. 

## Conclusion
The lab was very informative. We can easily determine if a material is water, acetone or oil based using its dielectric constant. The reason we use DI water as a calibration standard is because it’s neutral, and gives the maximum difference between a short and open circuit. One way we can improve the calibration process is to get a better stand that will wobble less. The dielectric probe can be used for both wideband and narrowband measurements but it works better if we use it for narrowband, I based my conclusion from the water data given above.  

## Hindsight
NA

## Reflection
The most rewarding part of this lab was getting to know about the background of the dielectric probe, and how complicated the math is to preform these measurements. It makes me appreciate the things we take advantage of.
