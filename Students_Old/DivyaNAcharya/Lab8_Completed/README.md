#Task1: Design of Quadrature Hybrid Coupler

## Background

Quadrature hybrids are 3dB  directional couplers with 90 degrees phase difference in the outputs of through and coupled arms. With all ports matched, the power entering port 1 is evenly divided between ports 2 and 3 with 90 degrees phase shift between the outputs. Port 4 is isolated and recieves no power from port 1.
The structure of this coupler is highly symmetric allowing any of the ports to be used as input ports. 



## Design
**Given**
- Center Frequency= 2.5GHz
- Zo=50ohms

**Calculations**
- Characteristic Impedance of horizontal strips =Z0/sqrt(2) =35.35ohms
- Width of horizontal strips =5.25mm
- Length of horizontal strips =16.5mm
- Width of 50ohms strips =3.1mm
- Length of 50 ohms strips =16.9mm


##Procedure
- Calculated design values were entered in HFSS file and simulated.
- Values were adjusted to get best response at center frequency
- David took VNA measurements of the milled coupler.




## Results and Discussion
1. Magnitude of reflection coefficients drops below -25dB at 2.5GHz for all ports showing good matching:

2. Plots show S21 and S31 at about -3dB for both Milled and HFSS results as required. Hence power is being split equally. Isolation at port 4 is clear by the fact that S41 drops below -35dB:

3. The phase difference of output signals at ports 2 and 3 is about 90deg as required for both Milled and HFSS results. The bandwidth for which the phase difference remains close to 90 is lesser for milled results compared to HFSS results.

## Observations
- The length of y trace (35.5ohms line) was adjusted from 16.5 to 20mm to get best response at 2.5GHz frequency.

#Task2: Design of Rat Race Coupler

## Background
![image](https://github.com/CourseReps/ECEN452-Spring2016/blob/master/Students/DivyaNAcharya/Lab8_Completed/RRBackground.PNG)

The rat race coupler provides 180 degrees or a 0degree phase shift between output ports depending on the input port used.The two input ports are called "sum" and "difference" input ports when used as a combiner.

## Design
**Given**
- Center Frequency= 2.5GHz
- Zo =50ohms

![image](https://github.com/CourseReps/ECEN452-Spring2016/blob/master/Students/DivyaNAcharya/Lab8_Completed/RatRace.PNG)

**Calculations**
- Impedance of circular strip =Zo*sqrt(2)=70.7ohms
- Total circumference of the strip = 3lambda/4 + lambda/4 +lambda/4 + lambda/4 =6lambda/4 =104.1mm
- Width of the circular strip = 1.68mm

##Procedure
- Calculated design values were entered in HFSS file and simulated.
- David took VNA measurements of the milled coupler.


## Results and Discussion
1. Magnitude of reflection coefficients drops below -25dB at 2.5GHz for all ports showing good matching:

2. Plots show S21 and S31 at about -3dB for both Milled and HFSS results as required. Hence power is being split equally. Isolation at port 4 in the HFSS result is clear by the fact that S41 drops to -40dB. The isolation observed for milled result is relatively lower.

3. The phase difference at output ports due to inputs at port 1 or 4 should be 0deg or 180deg respectively. Milled and HFSS results agree to this as required:

###Q&A
1. What modifications did you have to make to the T-line widths/lengths to improve your simulated results?
<br>As noted in the observations, the value for Hybrid coupler needed to be tweaked whereas rat race coupler gave good results without changes.
2. For what applications would each coupler be useful?
<br>The quadrature hybrid coupler can provide quadrature signals as the name suggests and can be used in design of mixers or simply for obtaining quadrature signals. The rat race coupler can be used for obtaining sum and difference of input signals.
3. Why did we put matched loads on the ports while measuring the S-parameters?
<br>Since the Hybrid coupler is a 4 port device, we had to explicitly match the un-connected ports to ensure accurate S parameter measurements.

## Observations
- The calculated values gave good results without any need to tweak the values.

## Conclusion
- The labs helped understand the design working and differences between the two types of coupler.
