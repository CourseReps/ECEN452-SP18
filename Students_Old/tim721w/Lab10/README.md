#Lab 10 Report

Chung-Huan Huang

## Background
In this lab, dielectric constant are measured for several fluid materials.
<br>

## Design
No design for this lab, the whole process of this lab was done by David.
<br>

## Procedure 
The dielectric constant measurement probe has to be calibrated before measuring. The setup uses three different measured results for calibration, air, short and water. Once confirming that water dielectric constant is similiar to ideal value, then starting to measure different kinds of fluid dielectric constants. (Before starging each measurement, calibriation must be done.)
<br>

## Results and Discussion
<br>Real part of dielectric constant

Expected value of fluids:
<br>Acetone : 20.7
<br>DI water: 80.1
<br>Ethylene Glyco: 37.0
<br>Isopropyl Alcoho: 19.92
<br>Silicone Fluid: 2.7

It can be seen that common fluid such as acetone and water expected dielectric constants are similiar as measured data. However, most of measured chemical dielectric constants are lower than expected values. This may due to different brand containing different contents and causing dielectric constants turn out different.

<br>Dielectric constant of DI water

It can be seen that dielectric constant of water decreases as frequency increases. This makes reasonable from Reference [1], because it becomes difficult for dipoles to align in the direction of field when thermal energy increases and causing dielectric constant decreases.
<br>

<br>Q1: DI water was used as a standard because it has a highest dielectric constant and least chemical ingredents, also it is a "known" dielectric property.
<br>
<br>Q2: In order to improve the calibration process, probe has to be cleaned each time before measurements. Furthermore, three standard measurements (air, short, water) should also be done before each measurement.
<br>
<br>Q3: The probe can be used for broadband measurement.
<br>
<br>Q4: The more water content in liquid, the higher dielectric constant is.
<br>
<br>Q5: WD 40 and Hydrocal are considered as "watered down" liquids, and Glass cleaner had the highest water content.


## Conclusion
The dielectric constants measured by the probe is very similiar to the ideal value (80.1 @ 20 degree Celcium). Even though there is a small difference, that may be caused by equipment error, human error, and temperature.
<br>

## Hindsight
Before measurement each time, the probe has to be calibrated and this technique is only good for fluid materials.
<br>

## Reflection
This is one of the ways to measure dielectric constant, especially is designed for fluid materials. It is very great to see the process of measuring.
