## Background

In this lab,I will design and simulate a patch antenna. Furthermore,I will match this antenna to 50 Ohms transmission line on the 62 mil thick FR-4 substrate.<br>

## Design

Use the following equations to calculate the length and width of the patch antenna:<br>

Base on FR-4 Substrate:<br>
er = 4.1 <br>
h = 1.5748 mm <br>
f = 3 GHz <br>

We can obtain:<br>
Length L = 24.27 mm <br>
Width W = 31.31 mm <br>

## Procedure
Task 1: Constructe the patch antenna using copper tape <br>
In this task, I use a single stub to match this antenna. <br>
Step 1: Calculate the length and width of the patch, the width of the 50 ohm transmission line. L = 24.27mm, W = 31.31mm, 50ohm transmisson line width W1 = 3.115 mm <br>
Step 2: Cut and solder the copper tape. <br>

Step 3: Test the unmatched patch antenna and we can get the input impedance = 73+j54,the normalized impedance is 1.46+j1.08. <br>
Step 4: Use smith chart to obtain the stub length. <br>
Step 5: Cut and solder the copper tape.<br>

Step 6: Measure the patch antenna. <br>


Task 2: Simulate the probe-fed patch antenna in HFSS.<br>
Step 1: Input the patch_length = 24.27mm , patch_width = 31.31mm and probe_feed_x = 5mm into the HFSS model, then run the simulation <br>
Step 2: Look at the VSWR plot to make sure the patch is resonant at 3 GHz and try to get the VSWR at 3 GHz below 1.2 <br>
Step 3: Based on the simulation and knowledge to determine whether to move the probe closer to center or closer to the edge of the patch, rerun the simulation <br>
Step 4: Repeat the Step 2 and Step 3 until we obtain the suitable result <br>

Note:<br>
1.Probe_feed_x = 6mm. <br>
2.I cannot match the patch antenna at 3 GHz only by tuning feed port location. So I change the length of patch antenna into 23.7mm, then it can fully match at 3 GHz and the value of VSWR is below 1.2.<br>
