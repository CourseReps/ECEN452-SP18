# Lab 10 Report
Deanna Sessions

## Background
This lab was an exercise in dielectric measurements. The dielectric properties of materials are highly important to consider when designing microwave and RF circuitry so it is important to understand how dielectric measurements are taken to better understand what determines a material's dielectric constant. The method used for testing a material's dielectric constant was achieved using the network analyzer, a dielectric measuring software, and a sensitive probe made of a coaxial cable to be placed in various liquids. This setup was then used to compare the dielectric qualities of liquids and determine their content based on how they measured up to known liquids such as water and acetone.

## Procedure
In this lab, the testing setup is crucial. The dielectric measurement probe is sensitive to any form of movement and must be recalibrated frequently to account for any disruptions that may have occurred. The probe is placed in an apparatus that keeps it stable, while also allowing it to move upward freely  to prevent damage if it were to hit the bottom of a beaker during testing. The probe is then calibrated using the network analyzer in a way that is similar to the calibrations done for microwave circuit and antenna testing. The probe is measured to three standards, air, a shorting block, and DI water. These three standards are the dielectric equivalent of short, open, and load. After calibration is complete, testing can begin. The probe is placed in each liquid and then it completes a frequency sweep from 1GHz to 5GHz to measure for the dielectric constant at each frequency. The liquids tested were WD-40, acetone, simply green cleaner, silicone fluid, "hippie" glass cleaner, Pine Sol, hydrocal, etholyene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol. The dielectric measurements of each of these liquids gave insight into the composition of the fluid such as which ones were water based, acetone based, etc.  

## Results and Discussion
Below is a graph of the different dielectric constants that were measured over the course of the lab. It is apparent to see that the water based liquids tend to have a higher dielectric because they have similar dielectric characteristics to water. The highest water content that was measured was in a glass cleaner that lacked acetone. The lower dielectrics are acetone and alcohol based products.

Below is a graph that shows the wide range of dielectric values for DI water as it sweeps though a wide range of frequencies.

## Conclusion
This lab presented the testing necessary to determine the dielectric values of different materials over a range of frequencies. This information is important because so much of RF and microwave design is based on the materials that are used. Many designs are moving toward fluids and knowing the characteristics of these fluids at different frequencies can help determine what liquid would be most useful in a certain design.

## Reflection
This lab was a lot of fun and provided us with an opportunity to have hands on experience with taking dielectric measurements while also relating it back to the previous measurements that had been taken over the semester.
