### Mid-Term Project: Data-Driven High Frequency Circuit Forensics

For this project you will need to deminstrate your knowledge of distributed transmission lines systems, time-domain reflectometry, and callibration techniques. Your goal is to estimate an unknown load impedance and use this informtion to determine what type of device or structure it is. You are provided with a collection of measurements and some basic information on the measurement system. You will need to remove the effects of interconnects and other systematic measurement errors to accomplish this.
