## Background
Dielectric Probe Kit is used to measure the dielectric constant of materials. Usually it is good for measuring the dielectric constant of liquids or soft solids. The dielectric probe kit consists of an open ended section of coaxial line. The dielectric constant is measured by immersing or keeping the coaxial probe in contact with the material. The fields from the open circuit fringe into the material and they change as they come in contact with the material. The reflection data is used to characterize the dielectric constant. This method can be used for broadband measurements.

## Design
There was no design in this lab.

## Procedure
First, the coaxial probe is callibrated. The callibration involves measuring open circuit, short circuit (done using a shorting block) and DI water. DI water is used in callibration because it has the highest dielectric constant. Then the coaxial feed is placed inside material under test and the measurement is taken. We use a different software to take the measurement. After the measurement, the coaxial probe is cleaned and re-callibrated (as the callibration is very sensitive) for the next sample measurement. To improve the callibration process, we need to make sure that the coaxial probe is stable and does not change its position a lot during the measurement process because this leads to considerable amount of error in the result.

## Results and Discussion

The dielectric constant of acetone is 20.7 from available data and the measured dielectric constant is around 21. Similarly, the dielectric constant of Ethylene Glycol is 37 and measured result is 26. The dielectric constant of Isopropyl Alcohol is 17.9 and measured value is 14.7. The dielectric constant of DI Water is 80.1 and measured is 78.

Since water is a polar liquid, its bonds relax at high frequency and thus the dielectric constant decreases. This behaviour can be observed in the plot above where the dielectric constant of water decreases from 20 MHz to 20 GHz.

## Conclusion
Alcohol based liquids have a dielectric constant in the range of 15 - 40. Oil based solutions have the dielectric constant in the lower range (0 - 10). Water based liquids have the highest dielectric constant. They are in the range of 70 - 80. Glass Cleaner has the highest amount of water and the other watered down liquids include Simple Green Cleaner and Pine Sol.

## Hindsight
If I knew the names of the samples to be measured for the dielectric constant before the lab, it would have given me more appreciation on the accuracy of the measurement method.

## Reflection
This lab gave me exposure to another measurement technique in RF.
