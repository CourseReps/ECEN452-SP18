#Lab 10 Report
Chenhao Sun

##Background
 The Lab is concerned with the use of an open-ended coaxial-line probe for making dielectric measurements on lossy materials. The input reflection coefficient of the probe is measured with a network analyser, and the permittivity is determined using an approximate circuit model for the probe admittance[1].
##Design
##Procedure
 Calibrate with DI Water at first(twice actually, cause first time calibration works not well), and then measure all other fluids step by step, cleaning of probe head was always done between each fluids measurement .

##Discussion

Q1 : Because DI_Water has highest dielectric constant about 81. <br>
Q2 : Since this probe measurement device is very sensitive, we can improve calibration quality by ensuring the stability of mechanical structure of this measurement system, and ensuring the temperature is stable, as well as protecting this measurement system away from wind produced by humam breathe or movement.<br>
Q3 : Yes, it can be used for wideband<br>
Q4 : As frequency increase, the real part of dielectric constant will be stable at first, and then decrease, however finnal will be stable again. <br>
Q5 : The most water-down will be WD_40, and most hightest water-content fluids will be Glass_Cleaner. <br>

##Conclusion
Measurement of dielectric constant is successfully performed.
