<b>ECEN 452-500: Ultra High Frequency Techniques</b><br>
Spring 2016 – Prof. Huff<br>
Lab 10 - Material Measurement<br>


<br>
<b>Introduction:<br>
This lab will demonstrate how to use the coaxial probe to measure the dielectric constant of different kinds of materials. A T-Line measurement has broadband and reasonable accuracy characteristics, so it's suitable in this experiment. <br>
During the calibration procedures, three different load will be used to test and they are short, open and water. The water has high dielectric constant around 81, so it is a good candidate in this work. Besides, the material under test such as different kinds of liquid should be thick enough to get decent fringing fields from the probe.<br>

Result:<br>
The experiment tests different kinds of liquid and the results are shown below.<br>

Conclusion:<br>

1. Dielectric constant of all the experimental material will change the values at different frequency. We observe the dielectric constant will decrease as the frequency goes higher.<br>
2. Dielectric loss ε" = σ/ω, for a lossless medium with σ =0, then ε" = 0. In this work, the lower the dielectric loss values means less loss. For example, the simple green cleaner has dielectric loss of 25 at 2.5 GHZ; on the other hand the WD 40 has dielectric loss less than 1. As a result, the simple green cleaner has higher loss than WD 40.<br>
