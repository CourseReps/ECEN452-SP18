## Background
1. Hybrid Coupler is a 4 port symmetric device that splits power equally with 90 degree of phase shift.

2. Rat-race Coupler has 2 operation mode
  + power split: 
      + divide input power from port 1 equally with 180 degree of phase shift between port 2 and port 3. Port 4 is isolated.
      + divide input power from port 2 equally with 0 degree of phase shift between port 1 and port 4. Port 3 is isolated.
  + combine input signal from port 1 and 4
      + summed output is at port 2
      + subtracted output is at port 3

## Design
### Hybrid Coupler
#### Specification: operating frequency = 2.5GHz; Z0 = 50ohms; substrate = FR4 (e_r = 4.1); substrate height = 62 mil
1. All T-line impedance is 50ohms except the vertical section; its impedance is 1/sqrt(2)*50ohms
2. [microstrip line calculator](http://www1.sphere.ne.jp/i-lab/ilab/tool/ms_line_e.htm) is used to calculated the microstrip line parameter
3. All parameter is simulated in ADS
4. The same parameter is inputted into HFSS. Minute tuning is required to get the structure to operate at 2.5GHz

## Results and Discussion
### Hybrid Coupler
1. From port matching figure, all ports are matched at the design frequency.
2. From port transmission figure, port 2 and port 3 have -3.5dB power split. The extra -0.5dB comes from the loss from the T-line. The s41 has very little power transfer indicates that port 1 and port 4 are isolated.
3. From port transmission phase figure, both simulated result and measured result have 90 degree phase difference between signals at port 2 and port 3 at the design frequency. The simulated reuslt has a minute difference in slope than the measured result.
4. From port isolation figure, port 2 and port 3 are isolated. There is no isolation between port 3 and port 4 or port 2 and port 4. It makes sense because of the symmetry of the structure.

3. From port transmission phase figure, the simulated result has 180 degree phase difference between signals at port 2 and port 3 at the design frequency. The measured result probably contains error.
4. From port isolation figure, port 2 and port 3 are isolated. There is no isolation between port 3 and port 4 or port 2 and port 4. It makes sense because of the symmetry of the structure.

## Conclusion
The symmetry of the device is easily seen by analyzing the s-parameter. The power split is close to -3dB, it will not be -3dB because of the loss of the T-line.
