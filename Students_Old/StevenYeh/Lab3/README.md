# Assignment
The data provided in this folder is the measured S21 magnitude and phase of the Line standard of a TRL kit. Your assignment is to use this data and the TRL properties below to calculate the following.

* valid frequency range for the TRL kit (extrapolate S21 phase plot to find the frequencies where the phase is -20deg and -160deg)<br>
<b>Ans:<br>
Estimate frequency from 1.45GHz to 8.7GHz

* effective dielectric constant of the material (use equation that relates physical length to electrical length)<br>
<b>Ans:<br>
phase shift = phi = 40.8388 degrees @ 3GHz<br>
lumda_g = (360/40.8388) * 6.44mm = 56.77mm <br>
lumda_g = lumda_air / squreroot(effective_dielectric_constant) => dielectric_constant_effective = 3.1<br></b>


* propagation velocity of the medium (use the effective dielectric constant calculated above)<br>
<b>Ans:<br>
V_g = c/squareroot(effective_dielectric_constant) = 1.7 * 10^8  (m/s)<br></b>



* attenuation coefficient in Np/m (use the magnitude at one frequency and convert dB/m to Np/m)<br>
<b>Ans:<br>
|S21| = -0.02936dB = 0.9933  @3GHz<br>
phi = -40.8388 degrees @ 3GHz<br>
attenuation = -20*log|S21| = -20*log0.9933 = 0.05839(dB)/6.44 * 10^-3 m<br>
attenuation = 9.07 dB/m = 9.07/8.68=1.04 NP/m<br></b>


## TRL Properties
Reflect Length (11 mm) <br>
Thru Length (22 mm) <br>
Line Length (28.44  mm) <br>
Line-Thru = 6.44 mm (**This is the physical length measured after the reference planes are established) <br>
Substrate thickness (62 mil) <br>

You only really need one frequency point to do this assignment. I suggest using 3 GHz since it is in the middle of the measured frequency band. The electrical length is the the negative of the phase measurement in degrees (e.g. phase = -45deg => electrical length = 45deg). Use the Line-Thru physical length in your calculations. 

Useful Equation: <br>

where l is a physical length, and theta is electrical length (phase) in degrees.
