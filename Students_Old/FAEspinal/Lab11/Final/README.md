# Lab 11 Report
Francisco A. Espinal

## Background
In this lab, we preformed free space measurements with GLR calibration. This calibration is similar to the TRL calibrations technique but is simpler. This is used for the measurements of permittivity or permeability of planar materials.  

## Design
We didn’t have a design. No calculations were made. 

## Procedure
Everything was already set up and ready to go when we got into the lab. We just watch our TA preform all the necessary tasks. First he calibrated the network analyzer in order for us to get precise measurements using open and short circuits. Next he did the calibration for the horn antennas using air and a metal plate. Then he measured multiple materials as he explained everything that was happening.   

## Results and Discussion

The dielectric constant of air is around 1, which is expected. Cardboard is around 1.4, and the plexiglass is around 2.5. They all change as the frequency increases.

S11 shows the reflections. By placing reflect in the before performing the calibration will give us the reference plane, and this will tell us where to place the time gates. The measurment must be done in the time domain so we can see where exactly the reflections appear, and in order to transform from the frequency domain to the time domain a Fourier transform must be done.

S21 of the Thru line is at 0 dB, which is very good.

## Conclusion
The GRL calibration worked perfectly. We could improve the calibration process by placing lens in front of the horn antennas to improve the beamwidth. Then the three material’s dielectric measurements behaved as expected, excluding the little error coming from the large beamwidth of the antennas. 


## Hindsight
NA

## Reflection
The most rewarding part of the lab was learning how this calibration was used in Diana project.
