## Background
Lab 10 concisted of measuring the dielectric constant for then different types of fluids.    

## Design
There was no design for this lab. The only part was the measurement which was done by David.  

## Procedure
David had a set-up which consisted of a coaxial probe that was cconnected to a stand. This allowed the set-up to be staionary. The first step of the measuring was to calibrate set-up. For this particular calibration, the three calibration requirements were, air, short, and water. Water was the first fluid measured because it has the highest dielectic and is well known. After water the next nine fluids were: silicone fluid, glass cleaner, Pine Sol, hydrocal, etholyene glycol, Simply Green, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and WD-40. Before each measurement the probe was re-calibrated. 

## Results and Discussion

## Conclusion
Before the lab, it was stated that water has the highest dielectric of 80. This was confiremed in the lab and it was seen that the fluids that had higher dielectrics were fluids that have been watered-down. The use of the coaxial probe is an ideal instrument for liquids or soft-solids. However it is not an effective way to measure the dielectric constant for hard solids because it makes a poor contact measurement. 

## Hindsight
It would have been beneficial to have looked up the dielectric constants of several fluids and compare them to the measurements

## Reflection
This lab was a great way to see how to use another calibration and measuremnet technique. There are several techniques that are able to be effective for different types of devices.
