    "\n",
    "Wilkinson power dividers split an input signal into two equal phase output signals, or combine two equal-phase signal into one in the opposite direction. It relies on quarter-wave transformers to match the split ports to the common port and. A resistor between the split ports isolates these ports from each other. \n",

    "### Couplers\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid couplers are the special case of a four-port directional coupler that is designed for a 3-dB (equal) power split. Hybrids come in two types, 90 degree or quadrature hybrids, and 180 degree hybrids. \n",
    "\n",
    "180° hybrid ring couplers (also called “rat race” couplers) are four-port devices used to either equally split an input signal or to sum two combined signals. An additional benefit of the hybrid ring is to alternately provide equally-split but 180 degree phase-shifted output signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3 dB, 90° hybrid coupler is a four-port device that is used either to equally split an input signal with a resultant 90° phase shift between output ports or to combine two signals while maintaining high isolation between the ports.\n",
